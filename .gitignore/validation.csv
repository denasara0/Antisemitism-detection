1,"Why this is happening in Israel today ???

Simply because the collective West closed an eye on this racist apartheid regime.
Israeli are doing to Arabs what Jews were enduring during WW2 against Nazi, nothing less.

Roles have been reversed, Israeli behaving like Nazis against Palestinians today.

Inconvenient truths."
0,How can it be that the massacre on October 7 only increased the hatred towards the Jews around the world?
0,"Your nuance is nauseating, and informs Jews where they sit — and stand. Whether or not America will remain safe for Jews is a real question. In the end, once all is not said and not done, God will redeem the Jewish people as He always does, but when."
0,"Gaza was fine on October 6. Then Yahya Sinwar and Hamas decided to launch a genocidal pogrom against Jews in the hope of igniting an apocalyptic race war that would destroy Israel and see millions of Jews marched from their homes in death columns.

How many innocents had to die for this insanity?"
0,There are over a thousand American Jews in Brooklyn tonight saying we refuse to let our grief be weaponized to justify a genocide in Gaza.
0,"Pro-Hamas law students paying the price 

""For seven months, since Oct. 7, university students have been enjoying revolutionary cosplay. Their faces swathed in Arafat scarves, they wave flags, demand Israel disinvestment, scream mantras premised in genocide of Jews: Living entirely in the moment, they find it all tremendously exhilarating. That there may be an eventual downside to their conduct doesn’t seem to occur to them."" - @BarbaraRKay

0,".@VoteRandyFine
 - Jews across the world are going through so much. We stand with Israel and there’s no tolerance for something like this on a State facility. https://x.com/VoteRandyFine/"
0,You think Jews resisting proselytizing by Christians is racist? LMAO ????????
0,"Rosh Hashanah: New Zionist simanim (symbols) for your meal - opinion: To deepen our vision, as 94% of Israeli Jews dip apples into honey, this Rosh Hashanah, let's add Zionist simanim (symbols) for unity. JPost http://dlvr.it/Sw19br"
0,"What the Torah says is irrelevant. Observant Jews practicing today don't murder Gays or transition gays to the other sex. Nasrallah, on the other hand, speaks for Hezbollah and reflects the attitudes of Shia (and other) Muslims throughout the middle east. Big difference."
1,Jews are the only ones who learned nothing from the holocaust… except strategy
1,Who's worse the Jews for lying or the goyim for believing?
1,"Zionist Nazis attacked aid trucks going to Gaza.

These are not Jews. These are Nazis who came from Europe and occupied the holy lands.

They have nothing to do with Judaism.

There is no one more vile, misanthropic, anti-religious than the Zionists."
1,"Here’s an Israeli Jew bragging about the Jews killing Jesus as he attempts to steal a Palestinian’s home. 

The House of Representatives just passed a bill making it ILLEGAL for me to post this video."
1,"NEW:

???????? The jews committed another massacre in Gaza tonight

Approximately two hours ago, the Israeli Air Force conducted a strike on tents housing displaced individuals in Al-Mawasi, near Khan Younis, in a new massacre. 

The attack resulted in at least 40 civilian deaths and many injuries, with bombs creating craters as deep as 9 meters in the designated 'humanitarian zone.' The IDF claimed they targeted a Hamas 'command and control center.'"
1,"Ben Shapiro says Jesus “was just another Jew who tried to lead a revolt and was killed for His troubles”. 

“I believe, like most Jews, that Jesus was NOT a prophet, performed NO miracles, and was  NOT raised from the dead.”

This is what modern day zionists believe. It’s blasphemy. If you’re a Christian and have been tricked into supporting this nonsense, please REPENT."
0,They don't hide it. You either support the fight against Hamas or you hate jews. There is no in-between.
0,"Babe, they literally blamed the Jews."
0,"Zionism is NOT Judaism
Jews, Christians and Muslims coexisted before colonial Zionists occupied Palestine and ruined it over the past century and a half... Slowly but surely, since the first settlement in 1872 to date.
????"
0,"The reason why @GadSaad
 is particularly hated by all the parasitic minds out there, is because they can't tell a Lebanese man to ""Go back to Poland"". 

The concept of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews makes their brains short-circuit."
1,Love  and solidarity with antizionist Jews ??
0,"???????? ???? ??????????
Muslim children are indoctrinated into hating Jews, Israelis, and other non muslims. I guess she is about 6 & believes in stabbing her ""enemies."""
1,"You wanna get really nuts on 9/11? Do a little research into the 5 Jews in a white Van celebrating, high fiving, laughing while they were watching and filming the WTC collapsing. 

I’m happy and not suicidal."
1,"Labor's insane Mis/Disinformation bill basically criminalises any serious criticism of the establishment's most harmful policies. Anything relating to climate change, Covid, vaccines, militarism, the Voice, NDIS, banking, jews, indigenous people, etc. will be punished."
0,"I don't oppose the butchery in Gaza because I love Hamas or hate Jews or love Islam or hate America.

I don't oppose the butchery in Gaza because I'm a lefty or a commie or an anarchist or an anti-imperialist.

I oppose the butchery in Gaza because I'm not a fucking psychopath.

Opposing Israel's butchery in Gaza is so obvious, so common sense, such a bare-minimum, fundamental-level, Being Human 101 position that if it isn't immediately self-evident to you after learning the basic facts, your problem is much, much deeper than whatever ideology or bias or prejudice you might happen to have. There's something wrong with you as a person.

If you support Israel's butchery in Gaza, you've got much bigger problems than merely not having the correct ist or ism belief system. You're just all fucked up inside. Your conditioning has made you into a generally shitty human being. You have deep and immensely consequential flaws in your character, and you won't mature as a person until you heal and transcend them."
0,"Very interesting how so many are up in arms about jews taking someone else's land, couldn't care less about someone else taking someone else's land. Hmm, what could trigger this reaction...What indeed ??"
0,"Twitter's crack moderation in action:

Cartoonishly antisemitic post blaming Jews for 9/11 -> all good

Reply making fun of the antisemitic post -> Hidden because it ""may violate X's rules against Hateful Conduct"""

0,"Seeing Jews and Muslims fighting over the shittiest piece of land on Earth makes me realize how privileged I am here in Canada. When you don’t have a hard-on for divinely sanctioned real estate allotment, the world is so much more beautiful.
