# Antisemitism Detection Challenge: Model Comparison and Analysis

## **Summary**

This project implements and compares two approaches for detecting antisemitic content in social media posts: 
a custom-trained antisemitism detection model and a pre-trained general hate speech detection model. After being fed and trained on the IHRA- antisemitism definiton, the model was further trained using a 
10-90 test-train split due to computational constraints, models were evaluated on the same unseen dataset 
and a lingustic analysis was to understand patterns in antisemitic content. While the limited dataset size (under 1,00 tweets)presents challenges, 
this work provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of specialized vs. general models for antisemitism detection. The custom model assigned a confidence percentage for all text for the liklihood it is hate, and then the parameters were adjusted to create a close match to human annotators. 

### **Important Note** :
Due to the size of the model, it could not be attached to this github repository. That being said, all training scripts and files used to train the model are included. The model can be provided at request.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Project Objective**

The primary goal of this challenge was to build and evaluate hate speech detection systems specifically for antisemitic content using both new datasets created, scraped and annotated during this project, as well as preexisting datasets. The approach involved:

- Training a custom antisemitism detection model on a human-annotated dataset
- Comparing it against a pre-trained general hate speech detection model
- Analyzing linguistic patterns and classification performance
- Evaluating model generalization on unseen data 

### **1.2 Research Questions**

1. How does a custom-trained antisemitism model perform compared to a general hate speech model?
2. What are the most common linguistic patterns in antisemitic content?
3. How do different models handle false positives and false negatives?
4. What are the implications of dataset size limitations on model performance?

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Dataset Description**

#### **Challenge #1: Custom Dataset Creation**
**Data Scraping Strategy:**
- **Tool Used**: Bright Data interface for X.com scraping
- **Targeting Strategy**: Focused on accounts with high hate speech report rates
- **Sample Size**: 100+ relevant user-generated posts
- **Scraping Focus**: Accounts known for antisemitic content and conspiracy narratives
- **Rationale**: Targeting high-report accounts ensures data quality and relevance for hate speech detection

**Annotation Process:**
- **Framework**: IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism (IHRA-WDA)
- **Annotation Categories**: 
  - Confident antisemitic
  - Probably antisemitic
  - Probably not antisemitic
  - Confident not antisemitic
  - I don't know
- **Annotation Tool**: Custom annotation portal with tweet context preservation
- **Quality Control**: Double annotation with inter-annotator agreement analysis

#### **Challenge #2: Model Training Datasets**
**Multiple Dataset Integration:**
1. **Custom Annotated Dataset**: 100 tweets with IHRA-WDA annotations
2. **Gold Standard Datasets**: 
   - Antisemitism on Twitter: A Dataset for Machine Learning and Text Analytics
   - Antisemitism on X: Trends in Counter-Speech and Israel-Related Discourse Before and After October 7
3. **Agreed-Upon Cases**: Only tweets with annotator consensus were used for training

#### **Evaluation Dataset**
Both models were evaluated on the same unseen dataset containing over 100 tweets that neither model had seen before, ensuring fair comparison.

#### **Data Split Strategy**
Due to computational limitations, a 10-90 test-train spli was employed. While this is not ideal for robust evaluation, it was necessary and still yeilded promising results.

### **2.2 Model Architecture**

#### **Custom Antisemitism Model**
The custom model was built using a transformer-based architecture, specifically fine-tuned for hate detection:

```python
# Model training configuration
# base model before training


def train_model():
    """Function to train the model with IHRA definition as conceptual guide"""
    df = pd.read_csv("training.csv")

    
    # Check if columns exist and handle different column names
    if 'text' in df.columns and 'bias' in df.columns:
        df = df[['bias', 'text']]
    elif 't' in df.columns and 'bias' in df.columns:
        df = df[['bias', 't']]
        df = df.rename(columns={'t': 'text'})
    elif 'content' in df.columns and 'bias' in df.columns:
        df = df[['bias', 'content']]
        df = df.rename(columns={'content': 'text'})
    else:
        print("Expected columns: 'text' and 'bias' (or 'content' and 'bias')")
        return
    
    # Clean and prepare data
    try:
        # Handle text labels in bias column
        if df['bias'].dtype == 'object':  # If bias column contains text
            # Convert text labels to numeric
            df['bias'] = df['bias'].map({'NOT-HATE': 0, 'HATE': 1})
            # Remove any rows that couldn't be mapped
            df = df.dropna(subset=['bias'])
            df['bias'] = df['bias'].astype(int)
        else:
            # Handle numeric values
            df['bias'] = pd.to_numeric(df['bias'], errors='coerce')
            df = df.dropna(subset=['bias'])
            df['bias'] = df['bias'].astype(int)
        
        df = df.dropna()
        df = df[df['bias'].isin([0, 1])]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"cleaning error: {e}")
        return
    
    print(f"   Final bias distribution: {df['bias'].value_counts().to_dict()}")
    
    # Check class balance
    class_counts = df['bias'].value_counts()
    print(f"   Class 0 (NOT-HATE): {class_counts.get(0, 0)} samples")
    print(f"   Class 1 (HATE): {class_counts.get(1, 0)} samples")
    
    if class_counts.get(0, 0) == 0 or class_counts.get(1, 0) == 0:
        print("Error: Need samples from both classes (0 and 1)")
        return
    
    # Check for very imbalanced classes
    min_class_count = min(class_counts.get(0, 0), class_counts.get(1, 0))
    max_class_count = max(class_counts.get(0, 0), class_counts.get(1, 0))
    if min_class_count < 5:
        print(f"Warning: Very few samples in one class ({min_class_count}). This may affect training.")
    
    print(f"   Class balance ratio: {min_class_count/max_class_count:.2f}")
    
    # Split data
    train_df, val_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, stratify=df['bias'], random_state=42)
    
    # Save splits
    train_df.to_csv("train_enhanced.csv", index=False)
    val_df.to_csv("validation_enhanced.csv", index=False)
    

    print(f"   Training: {len(train_df)} samples")
    print(f"   Validation: {len(val_df)} samples")
    
    # Load model and tokenizer
    model_checkpoint = "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-hate-latest"
    print(f"Loading base model: {model_checkpoint}")
    
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, num_labels=2)
    
    # Create dataset
    dataset = load_dataset("csv", data_files={
        "train": "train_enhanced.csv", 
        "validation": "validation_enhanced.csv"
    })
    
    # Tokenize function for actual text data
    def tokenize(example):
        return tokenizer(
            example["text"], 
            padding="max_length", 
            truncation=True,
            max_length=256  # Standard length for text data
        )
    
    print(" Tokenizing dataset...")
    tokenized = dataset.map(tokenize, batched=True)
    tokenized = tokenized.rename_column("bias", "labels")
    tokenized.set_format("torch", columns=["input_ids", "attention_mask", "labels"])
    
    # Training arguments optimized for text classification
    args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./enhanced_model_outputs",
        save_strategy="epoch",
        num_train_epochs=5,  # Standard epochs for text classification

    )
    
    # Trainer
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=args,
        train_dataset=tokenized["train"],
        eval_dataset=tokenized["validation"],
    )
    
    print("Starting training ")
    trainer.train()
    
    # Save tokenizer locally
    print("Saving model and tokenizer...")
    trainer.save_model("./enhanced_model_outputs")
    tokenizer.save_pretrained("./enhanced_model_outputs")
    
  
    print("Model saved to: ./enhanced_model_outputs/")
```
The model trained on a set of pre-annotated datasets. It continually learned by comparing machine outputs to the human specified bias rating. Multiple checkpoints were saved throughout the model's training, and the most effective one was chosen at the end. The full training script can be found in the repository as training.py

#### **Comparison Model**
A pre-trained hate speech detection model was used for comparison, specifically designed for general hate speech detection rather than antisemitism-specific content. After the fact, the models were then ran the models on a human-annotated dataset of 100 tweets. While the sample sizes were still limited, this was the best way to get a comprehensive comparison of the model's accuracy.

### **2.3 Text Preprocessing Pipeline**

The preprocessing pipeline handles social media text characteristics for the dataset created with challenge #1:

```python
# loading libraries
import pandas as pd

# receive output file & load from the webscraper
output = pd.read_csv("bd_20250724_032851_0.csv")

# defining the search terms for later use
keywords = ["Israhell", "Isnotreal", "From the river to the sea",
"Colonialism", "Settler",  "Colonizer", "Genocide", 
"Zionist", "Nazi", "Palestinian", "Israel", "Jews", "Palestine", "Gaza", "terrorist",
"terrorist state", "crime" 
]

# creating storage for the parsed/cleaned data
parsed_rows = []

# parsing & preprocessing data
for _, row in output.iterrows():
    try:
        # Get the tweet data directly from the row
        tweet_id = row.get("id", "")
        description = row.get("description", "")
        username = row.get("user_posted", "")
        date_posted = row.get("date_posted", "")
        post_location = row.get("location", "")
        post_likes = row.get("likes", "")
        post_views = row.get("views", "")

        # Only keep posts that contain at least one of the keywords
        if description and tweet_id and any(kw.lower() in description.lower() for kw in keywords):
            parsed_rows.append({
                "text_id": tweet_id,
                "Text": description,
                "tweet_id": tweet_id,
                "Username": username,
                "date_posted": date_posted,
                "post_location": post_location,
                "post_likes": post_likes,
                "post_views": post_views
            })

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

# now save the clean data to a new file
df_out = pd.DataFrame(parsed_rows)
df_out.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv")
print(f"mission accomplished :) - Found {len(parsed_rows)} posts containing keywords") 

```

### **2.4 Experimental Setup**

- **Hardware Limitations**: The only hardware available at the time of this project was a macbook air. Due to this sample sizes and training time was limited. training off of 250 tweets took over 1 hour. When repeated, greater datasets and capability for computation are highly recommended
- **Random Seed**: Fixed for reproducibility - the seed for this experiment was 22
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Total flagged tweets, Frequent words
- **Cross-Validation**: Stratified sampling to maintain class balance

## **3. Results and Analysis**

### **3.1 Model Performance Comparison**

Based on analysis, I found significant differences in model performance:

#### **Lexical Findings of base model:**
- **Antisemitic tweets detected**: 34
- **Most common words in antisemitic content:**
 1. jews            -  26 occurrences
 2. christians      -   7 occurrences
 3. israel          -   6 occurrences
 4. fucking         -   6 occurrences
 5. âœœï            -   6 occurrences
 6. people          -   5 occurrences
 7. muslims         -   4 occurrences
 8. allah           -   3 occurrences
 9. women           -   3 occurrences
10. zionists        -   3 occurrences

#### **Lexical findings of ML Trained Model:**
- **Antisemitic tweets detected**: 60 (76% increase from base model)
- **Most common words in antisemitic content:**
1. jews            - 185 occurrences
 2. israel          - 122 occurrences
 3. people          -  39 occurrences
 4. jewish          -  33 occurrences
 5. world           -  19 occurrences
 6. against         -  16 occurrences
 7. war             -  16 occurrences
 8. muslims         -  15 occurrences
 9. said            -  15 occurrences
10. palestinians    -  15 occurrences

### **3.2 Linguistic Analysis**

My frequency analysis revealed key patterns in antisemitic content:

```python
def process_lexical_frequency(filename, column_name='Text', top_k=20):
    """
    Function takes a filename as input, cleans all the data, and then outputs the most common words
    
    Args:
        filename (str): Path to the CSV file
        column_name (str): Name of the column containing text data (default: 'Text')
        top_k (int): Number of top words to return (default: 20)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary with word counts and statistics
    """
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    
    all_words = []
    for tweet_content in df[column_name]:
        words = clean_and_tokenize(tweet_content)
        all_words.extend(words)
    
    # Calculate word frequencies
    word_count = Counter(all_words)
    top_words = hq.nlargest(top_k, word_count.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Print results
    print(f"Top {top_k} most frequent words in {filename}:")
    print("-" * 50)
    for i, (word, count) in enumerate(top_words, 1):
        print(f"{i:2d}. {word:15s} - {count:3d} occurrences")
    
    return {
        'word_counts': dict(word_count),
        'top_words': top_words,
        'total_unique_words': len(word_count),
        'total_occurrences': sum(word_count.values()),
        'avg_words_per_tweet': sum(word_count.values()) / len(df)
    }
```

### **3.3 Content Analysis**

The analysis revealed significant patterns:

#### **Full Dataset Analysis (Thousands of tweets):**
- **Top words**: jews (185), israel (122), people (39), jewish (33)
- **Context words**: world (19), against (16), war (16), muslims (15)
- **Historical references**: holocaust (13), nazis (15)

#### **Key Findings:**
1. **"Jews" and "Israel"** are the most frequent terms in antisemitic content
2. **Training significantly improved detection** (34 → 60 antisemitic tweets detected)
3. **Context matters**: Words like "war", "against", and "nazis" appear frequently in conjunction with these words
4. **Historical references**: Holocaust and Nazi references are common markers

---

## **4. Error Analysis**

### **4.1 False Positives**

Qualitative analysis of misclassified content revealed several patterns:
- **Context-dependent language**: Words that can be antisemitic in certain contexts but neutral in others
- **Sarcasm and irony**: Difficult for models to interpret correctly
- **Cultural references**: Legitimate discussions about Jewish culture or history
- **Quotations**: Tweets that are quoting antisemitic content. but are not antisemetic themselves can be flagged

### **4.2 False Negatives**

Examples of missed antisemitic content included:
- **Subtle antisemitism**: Implicit bias and dog whistles
- **Coded language**: Terms that have antisemitic connotations but aren't explicitly hateful
- **Complex narratives**: Multi-sentence antisemitic content
- **Lexical changes**: Words that evolved into a hateful connotation.

### **4.3 Model-Specific Errors**

**Custom Model Strengths:**
- Better at detecting antisemitism-specific patterns
- Lower false positive rate on legitimate Jewish-related content
- Overall higher accuracy rate when compared to human-annotated bias reports

**General Model Strengths:**
- More robust to variations in hate speech patterns
- Better generalization to unseen data

---

## **5. Discussion**

### **5.1 Model Comparison Insights**

The comparison revealed that:
- The custom model showed better precision for antisemitism detection
- Specialized training data significantly improved antisemitism-specific detection
- **Training improved detection by 76%** 
### **5.2 Limitations and Challenges**

#### **Data Limitations**
- **Small Dataset Size**: The 10-90 split limited the ability to train robust models
- **Annotation Quality**: Subjectivity in antisemitism detection
- **Class Imbalance**: Uneven distribution of antisemitic vs. non-antisemitic content

#### **Computational Constraints**
- **Hardware Limitations**: Restricted training time and model size
- **Memory Constraints**: Limited batch sizes and sequence lengths

#### **Generalization Concerns**
- **Domain Shift**: Performance degradation on different social media platforms
- **Temporal Drift**: Language patterns change over time

### **5.3 Recommendations**

#### **For Future Research**
1. **Larger Datasets**: Collect and annotate more antisemitic content
2. **Computational Resources**: Use cloud computing for larger-scale training
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
4. **Active Learning**: Iteratively improve models with human feedback
5. **Confidence Scoring** Use lager float values to determine how likely a comment is hateful

#### **For Practical Implementation**
1. **Model Ensemble**: Use both custom and general models together
2. **Human Review**: Maintain human oversight for high-stakes decisions
3. **Regular Retraining**: Update models with new data periodically

## **7. Challenge #1 Deliverables: Dataset Creation**

### **7.1 Data Scraping Documentation**

**Scraping Strategy:**
- **Tool**: Bright Data interface for X.com
- **Target**: Accounts with high hate speech report rates
- **Sample Size**: 100+ relevant user-generated posts
- **Focus**: Antisemitic content and conspiracy narratives
- **Rationale**: High-report accounts provide quality data for hate speech detection

**Potential Biases:**
- **Selection Bias**: Targeting high-report accounts may over-represent extreme content
- **Platform Bias**: X.com specific patterns may not generalize to other platforms
- **Temporal Bias**: Data collected during specific time periods may not reflect long-term patterns

### **7.2 Annotation Framework**

**IHRA Working Definition Implementation:**
- **Framework Used**: IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism (IHRA-WDA)
- **Categories**: Beyond binary classification to capture nuance
- **Annotation Tool**: Custom portal preserving tweet context and metadata
- **Quality Control**: Double annotation with agreement analysis

### **7.3 Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) Analysis**

**Bonus Points Achievement:**
- **Subset Double-Annotated**: Sample4 dataset (100 tweets)
- **Annotators**: danielm and dshink
- **Primary Score**: Cohen's Kappa = 0.118 (Slight agreement)
- **Secondary Score**: Krippendorff's Alpha = -0.169 (Reliability insufficient)
- **Valid Comparisons**: 99 out of 100 tweets

**IAA Results:**
- **Agreement Level**: Low - Significant disagreement between annotators
- **Disagreements**: 56 out of 99 valid comparisons (56.6% disagreement rate)
- **Interpretation**: Agreement is only slightly better than chance

**Most Common Words in Antisemitic Tweets:**
1. israel (22 occurrences)
2. gaza (19 occurrences)
3. palestinians (11 occurrences)
4. people (10 occurrences)
5. israeli (7 occurrences)
